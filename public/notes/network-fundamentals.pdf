## Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networks

### What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources with each other. These devices include computers, servers, routers, switches, and other networking equipment.

### Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Networks within a limited geographical area
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Networks spanning large geographical areas
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Networks covering a city or metropolitan area
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Networks for personal devices

### Network Components
- **Nodes**: Any device connected to the network
- **Links**: Physical or logical connections between nodes
- **Protocols**: Rules governing communication
- **Services**: Applications and resources available on the network

## Chapter 2: OSI Model Deep Dive

### The Seven Layers
1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with physical transmission of data
2. **Data Link Layer**: Provides error detection and correction
3. **Network Layer**: Handles routing and logical addressing
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data delivery
5. **Session Layer**: Manages communication sessions
6. **Presentation Layer**: Handles data formatting and encryption
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services to applications

### Layer Functions and Protocols
Each layer has specific functions and associated protocols that enable network communication.

## Chapter 3: TCP/IP Protocol Suite

### Internet Protocol (IP)
- IPv4 addressing and subnetting
- IPv6 implementation and benefits
- CIDR notation and VLSM

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Connection-oriented communication
- Reliable data delivery
- Flow control and congestion management

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Connectionless communication
- Fast but unreliable delivery
- Use cases and applications

## Chapter 4: Network Security Fundamentals

### Security Principles
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)
- Authentication and Authorization
- Non-repudiation

### Common Threats
- Malware and viruses
- Phishing attacks
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- DDoS attacks

### Security Measures
- Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Encryption and VPNs
- Access control and monitoring
